# SR-110U-Prog
Allstarlink Programing script for SR-110U based boards
I was helping some friends setup an allstarlink node with a pi 3 and a chinese interface that was labeled SA818 but in reality is has an SR-110U and its commands are a bit different to get working. 

Based on information from https://d3s5r33r268y59.cloudfront.net/datasheets/2309/2022-11-02-12-07-14/SR-110U_UHF-1W_two_way_radio__Data_Transfer_module_S_R4fLPQo.pdf
